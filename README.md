# cloud-burst-templates

This repository contains templates for the creation of research computing pipelines that adapt certain classes of traditional HPC workloads to be run using serverless and transient cloud resources.  Initially, the templates are available for [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud), but the cloud features used for these pipelines are available in any public cloud provider.

The work contained in this repository is a product of the [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca/) [Centre for Advanced Computing](https://cac.queensu.ca/), with assistance from [IBM Canada](https://www.ibm.com/ca-en).
